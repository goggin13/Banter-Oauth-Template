# Sample Banters OAuth Application

This application provides the bare minimum skeleton of code needed to
access the API at Banters.com.

To get started, all you need to do is update the following lines, 

`CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'`  
`CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'`  

in **py/main.py** with your credentials, which you should have received 
when you [registered an application](https://banters.com/api/apps).

For more details and API calls, view the [API docs](https://banters.com/api/doc).
